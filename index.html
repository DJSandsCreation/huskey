      <h2 class='story half other-sections'>Husky History:</h2>
      <p class='article-text'>Both Russia and the United States like to lay claim to the Siberian husky. The breed was
        developed by the Chukchi
        tribe of northeast Asia over 3,000 years ago to help them in their nomadic life as sled pullers. Certainly, the
        breed has spitz ancestors.</p>
      <p class='article-text'>During the Alaskan gold rush, many sled dog races were set up for amusement as well as for
        checking out working
        stock. The dogs from the Chukchis proved to be fast runners of great endurance despite their small size.</p>

      <p class='article-text'>The classic northern dogs, Siberian huskies are friendly and intelligent but somewhat
        independent and stubborn.
        They thrive on human company, but need firm, gentle training from puppyhood.</p>

    <article class='story quarter'>
      <h2 class='story half other-sections'>More Husky History:</h2>
      <p class='article-text'>The fame of the Siberian husky as a racing sled dog was cemented when a team of Huskies
        raced 340 miles through
        raging blizzards to deliver serum for diphtheria-stricken Nome. The movie "Balto" and the many stories on the
        same
        theme have made this breed recognised by people worldwide.</p>
      <p class='article-text'>While most of today's Siberian huskies are beloved family pets, many still pull sleds in
        local races and enjoy
        skijoring with their owners.</p>

      <h2>Personality:</h2>
      <p class='article-text'>Siberian huskies are classic northern dogs. They are intelligent but somewhat independent
        and stubborn. They
        thrive on human company, but need firm, gentle training from puppyhood. These are dogs bred to run, and their
        love
        of running may overcome their love for their guardians at times. Siberian huskies tend to be friendly with
        people,
        including children.</p>
      <p class='article-text'>Most Siberian huskies are good with other dogs, especially ones they are raised with. They
        have a high prey drive
        and may chase cats and livestock. Siberian huskies can be diggers, particularly in warm weather, because they
        like
        to create cool places to lie in. They don’t tend to bark as a rule but they do howl.</p>

    <article class='story quarter'>
      <h2>Living With:</h2>
      <p class='article-text'>Siberian huskies were developed under harsh conditions and, not surprisingly, are easy
        dogs to keep. They can
        easily become obese if overfed or not exercised. These are dogs bred for running, and they should have a good
        run
        at least a couple of times weekly. Siberian huskies tend to be hardy dogs and often live to 14 years of age.</p>
      <p class='article-text'>Early positive training and socialisation are important for the Siberian husky to focus on
        people. These dogs
        enjoy human company and like having a job to do, even if it is just jogging with you. Siberian huskies are not
        noted for watchdog tendencies but will usually alarm bark. Left alone too much, they can be diggers and chewers
        or
        will give the neighbours a lovely howling concert. Siberian huskies do enjoy sledding and skijoring.</p>
      <p class='article-text'>Grooming should be done a couple of times a week, with more grooming needed during
        shedding season. The shorter
        coat of the Siberian husky is less prone to matts than the coats of other northern dogs.</p>

      <h2>In popular culture</h2>
      <p class='article-text'>A bronze statue of the real Balto that has been displayed in New York City’s Central Park
        since 1925 is one of its enduringly popular features.</p>
      <p class='article-text'>The television series Game of Thrones caused a huge uptick in demand for Siberian Huskies
        as pets, followed by a steep increase of their numbers at public shelters. Even though the animal actors were
        not Siberian Huskies, people were acquiring Siberian Huskies because they looked similar to the fictional
        direwolf characters depicted in the show.Two of the show's stars pleaded with the public to stop acquiring the
        dogs without first researching the breed.</p>
      <p class='article-text'>Characters in film and television: The film Eight Below features six Siberian Huskies
        whose names are Max, Maya, Truman, Old Jack, Dewey and Shorty. In the horror television series Z Nation, a
        character adopts a Siberian Husky after its owner freezes to death outside his base, and the other dog turned
        into a zombie. The T.V. show Parks and Recreation uses a Siberian Husky as "spirit dog" for April Ludgate.</p>

      <h2>Siberian Husky</h2>

      <a href="url">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>
      <p class='article-text'>The Siberian Husky (Russian: Сибирский хаски, tr. Sibirskiy khaski) is a medium-sized
        working dog breed. The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred
        double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings, and is smaller than a very similar-looking dog,
        the Alaskan Malamute.</p>
      <p class='article-text'>Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they are bred by the Chukchi people
        for sled-pulling, guarding, and companionship. It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors
        lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, a Russian fur trader,
        introduced them to Nome, Alaska during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs.</p>
